      Although I appreciate the importance of Javascript and frontend technology, I am heavily interested in exploring the potential of Python and its backend frameworks to build scalable applications and software. 
     I find nature fascinating and also enjoy a wide range of alternative music.
 In my spare time, I like to scribble my thoughts into words - it also makes for good poetry. 
     I like to think that I possess problem solving skills that will benefit any organisation regardless of its scale. I appreciate good work ethic and positive spirited people.
     Looking forward to working on your projects or simply connecting over a cup of coffee.
